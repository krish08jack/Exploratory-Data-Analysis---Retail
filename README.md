Exploratory-Retail task 3
Data of retail sales was overly summarized loses as its ability to inform something effective was less. When it’s too detailed, rapid interpretation of the data is compromised. Visual analytics bridges this gap by providing the right style of data visualization and detail for the situational need. The ideal exploratory analysis and reporting tool tableau is used with keeping in mind the following attributes:
Simplicity—Be easy for non-technical users to understand.
Connectivity—Seamlessly connect to a large variety of datasources.
Visual Competence—Provide appropriate graphics . 
Sharing—Facilitate sharing of insight.
Scale—Handle large data sets.
In this analysis Crosstabs were not the most effective way to make one-to-many comparisons or identify outliers.Whereas Pie charts are commonly used for comparisons but are one of the least effective ways to compare values across dimensions. It is difficult to make precise comparisons especially between slices, and even more so when there are many slices. Bar charts provide a better means for comparing product sub-categories. The heat map on the right provides total sales for each category.  The gray scale color range highlights the high and low selling product sub-categories. The color encoding in the bar chart provides additional information on profit ratio. Reference lines in the bar chart display the average sales for all product subcategories within each region.
Clearly the bar chart and heat map communicate the sales values more quickly while adding profit ratio information with the use of color. The reference lines within each region and product category provide average sales values.
Appropriate visual analytics improve decision-making by making it easier to see summary trends and outliers without sacrificing desired details by making those details available on demand
